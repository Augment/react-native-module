# How to use this example

We assume that you have all the [dependencies](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) installed for both iOS (remember to install also _CocoaPods_) and Android.

- run `npm install` to install react dependencies.
- run `pod install` on `ios/` folder to install our SDK on the sample.

__iOS__ : Now you can open Xcode (using the .`xcworkspace` file) and run the app (only) in a device.

__Android__: If you had installed [`react-native-cli`](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html#the-react-native-cli) you can just plug your device (remember to enable USB Debugging) and run `react-native run-android` or you can also import `sample/android` in Android Studio and run it.

If you encounter any problem [let us know](https://github.com/Augment/react-native-module/issues).

For more information, go to [Augment developers documentation](https://developers.augment.com/react-native-sdk) and run the sample.
