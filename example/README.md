# How to use this example

For a simple test application, initialise a test app with:

```
react-native init sample_app
```

When done, rename `react-native-example-index.js` to `App.js` and replace the existing file in `sample_app/`.

Follow the setup instructions on the [Augment developers documentation](https://developers.augment.com/react-native-sdk) and run the sample.
